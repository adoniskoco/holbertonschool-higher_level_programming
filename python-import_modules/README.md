# Python Project Task Descriptions

- **0. Task: Addition Function**  
  **Filename:** `0-add.py`  
  Write a program that imports the function `def add(a, b):` from the file `add_0.py` and prints the result of adding 1 and 2. The expected output will be `3`.

- **1. Task: Calculator Operations**  
  **Filename:** `1-calculation.py`  
  Import various mathematical functions from `calculator_1.py`, perform some calculations, and print the result. This task practices importing and using multiple functions in Python.

- **2. Task: Argument Counting and Listing**  
  **Filename:** `2-args.py`  
  Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed to it and lists them. This task practices handling command-line arguments in Python using `sys.argv`.

- **3. Task: Infinite Addition**  
  **Filename:** `3-infinite_add.py`  
  Take any number of arguments and compute the sum of all of them. The goal is to handle an arbitrary number of inputs and perform addition using `sys.argv` or similar techniques.

- **5. Task: Loading a Variable from Another File**  
  **Filename:** `5-variable_load.py`  
  Import the variable `a` from the file `variable_load_5.py` and print its value. This exercise helps practice variable import and working with different file structures in Python.
