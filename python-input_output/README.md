# README for Python Project

This project contains several tasks, each implemented as Python functions and scripts. Below is a concise description of each task, along with the corresponding filenames.

---

### **Task Descriptions**

#### 1. **0-read_file.py**
   **Description**: This task involves creating a function that reads a text file encoded in UTF-8 and prints its contents to the standard output (stdout).
   
#### 2. **1-write_file.py**
   **Description**: Write a function that takes a string and writes it to a text file encoded in UTF-8. The function returns the number of characters written to the file.
   
#### 3. **2-append_write.py**
   **Description**: Create a function that appends a given string to the end of a text file (UTF-8 encoded). It returns the number of characters added to the file.

#### 4. **3-to_json_string.py**
   **Description**: Write a function that returns the JSON string representation of an object (typically a string).

#### 5. **4-from_json_string.py**
   **Description**: This task requires writing a function that takes a JSON string and returns the corresponding Python object (data structure).

#### 6. **5-save_to_json_file.py**
   **Description**: Write a function that saves a Python object (data structure) into a text file in JSON format.

#### 7. **6-load_from_json_file.py**
   **Description**: Create a function that loads and returns a Python object from a JSON file.

#### 8. **7-add_item.py**
   **Description**: This script takes command-line arguments, adds them to a Python list, and saves the list to a file.

#### 9. **8-class_to_json.py**
   **Description**: Write a function that returns the dictionary description for JSON serialization of an object. The object should have simple data structures like lists, dictionaries, strings, integers, and booleans.

#### 10. **9-student.py**
   **Description**: This task involves writing a `Student` class that defines a student with certain attributes.

#### 11. **10-student.py**
   **Description**: Based on task 9, extend the `Student` class to include more attributes and methods for additional functionality.

#### 12. **11-student.py**
   **Description**: Building on the previous tasks, create a more advanced version of the `Student` class, adding further properties and functionalities.

#### 13. **12-pascal_triangle.py**
   **Description**: Implement a function `pascal_triangle(n)` that returns a list of lists representing Pascal's triangle of size `n`.
