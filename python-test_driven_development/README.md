# Python Project Tasks

This repository contains a series of Python tasks aimed at demonstrating different programming concepts and testing methods. Each task is described below:

## Task 0 - Add Two Integers
**Filename:** `0-add_integer.py`  
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result. The function ensures the inputs are valid integers, performing the necessary type checks and conversions if needed.

---

## Task 1 - Divide All Elements of a Matrix
**Filename:** `2-matrix_divided.py`  
Write a function that takes a matrix (a list of lists) and divides all its elements by a specified divisor. The function also handles edge cases such as division by zero and non-numeric inputs.

---

## Task 2 - Print Full Name
**Filename:** `3-say_my_name.py`  
Write a function that prints the full name by accepting two strings (first name and last name) and concatenating them into a message: "My name is <first name> <last name>". The function ensures the inputs are strings.

---

## Task 3 - Print a Square
**Filename:** `4-print_square.py`  
Write a function that prints a square of `#` characters with a given size. The function ensures the size is a positive integer and handles invalid inputs appropriately.

---

## Task 4 - Text Indentation
**Filename:** `5-text_indentation.py`  
Write a function that takes a string and prints it with two newlines after every occurrence of the characters `.`, `?`, and `:`. The function ensures proper formatting and ignores extra spaces after these characters.

---

## Task 5 - Unit Testing Max Integer Function
**Filename:** `6-max_integer_test.py`  
In this task, you'll write unit tests for the function `def max_integer(list=[])`. The function returns the largest integer from the list. The task involves creating test cases that check for different list scenarios, including empty lists and lists with negative values.
