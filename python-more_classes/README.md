# Project: Rectangle Class Development in Python

This project consists of multiple tasks where we progressively build a `Rectangle` class, with each task introducing additional functionality. Each task is contained within a Python file that builds upon the previous one. Below is a brief description of each task and the corresponding file.

---

### Task Descriptions

- **Filename: `0-rectangle.py`**  
  *Write an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.*  
  This task initializes the `Rectangle` class with no attributes or methods, serving as the foundation for future tasks.

- **Filename: `1-rectangle.py`**  
  *Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `0-rectangle.py`).*  
  This task introduces basic attributes for the `Rectangle` class but with minimal functionality.

- **Filename: `2-rectangle.py`**  
  *Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `1-rectangle.py`).*  
  In this task, we add further details to the `Rectangle` class, such as instance variables and potentially other basic methods.

- **Filename: `3-rectangle.py`**  
  *Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `2-rectangle.py`).*  
  The `Rectangle` class continues to evolve, and new features or methods are likely added, including but not limited to methods for setting or getting attributes.

- **Filename: `4-rectangle.py`**  
  *Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `3-rectangle.py`).*  
  At this stage, additional functionality is likely implemented, such as methods for calculating properties like area or perimeter.

- **Filename: `5-rectangle.py`**  
  *Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `4-rectangle.py`).*  
  This task refines the `Rectangle` class further, possibly enhancing its internal structure with more advanced features or optimizations.

- **Filename: `6-rectangle.py`**  
  *Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `5-rectangle.py`).*  
  The class continues to evolve with additional features or refactorings to improve functionality or usability.

- **Filename: `7-rectangle.py`**  
  *Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `6-rectangle.py`).*  
  In this task, the `Rectangle` class likely becomes more feature-rich, with improvements to support various use cases and functionality.

- **Filename: `8-rectangle.py`**  
  *Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `7-rectangle.py`).*  
  This stage focuses on refining the class with new additions, optimizations, or possibly extending its capabilities even further.

- **Filename: `9-rectangle.py`**  
  *Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle by: (based on `8-rectangle.py`).*  
  The final task builds upon the previous stages and is likely the culmination of the work, with a fully implemented `Rectangle` class offering comprehensive functionality.
