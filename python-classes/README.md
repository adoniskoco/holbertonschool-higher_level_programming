# Square Class Project

This project contains several tasks that demonstrate the creation and enhancement of a `Square` class in Python. Each task builds upon the previous one, progressively adding new functionality to the class.

## Tasks

### Task 0: `0-square.py`
**Description**:  
In this task, an empty class `Square` is defined. This is the initial setup, where the class has no attributes or methods.

---

### Task 1: `1-square.py`
**Description**:  
The `Square` class is defined with an initializer method (`__init__`). It now accepts a size attribute (`size`) that initializes the square's size. This task introduces the concept of setting attributes in the class.

---

### Task 2: `2-square.py`
**Description**:  
The `Square` class is extended by adding a method to compute the area of the square. The `area` method returns the square's area, which is the square of its size.

---

### Task 3: `3-square.py`
**Description**:  
This task enhances the `Square` class by adding a validation check. The size of the square is now validated to ensure it is a positive integer. If an invalid size is provided, an exception is raised.

---

### Task 4: `4-square.py`
**Description**:  
The `Square` class is further enhanced by adding a method that prints the square using the `#` character. This method visually represents the square, allowing the user to see the shape of the square based on its size.

---

### Task 5: `5-square.py`
**Description**:  
In this task, the `Square` class is modified to allow for a position attribute (`position`). This attribute controls where the square is printed in the terminal by adding spaces before printing the square. The position is specified as a tuple of two integers (x, y).

---

### Task 6: `6-square.py`
**Description**:  
This final task refines the `Square` class by adding a getter and setter for the `size` attribute. This ensures that the size can be retrieved and modified with appropriate validation for the `size` attribute.
