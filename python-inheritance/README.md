# README for Python Project

This project consists of multiple tasks implemented in Python, covering object-oriented programming concepts like inheritance, instance checking, and class methods. Below is a brief description of each task along with the respective file name.

---

### Task 0: Lookup Object Attributes and Methods
**Filename:** `0-lookup.py`

This task implements a function that returns a list of available attributes and methods of an object. It uses the built-in `dir()` function to achieve this.

---

### Task 1: MyList Class Inheriting from List
**Filename:** `1-my_list.py`

This task defines a class `MyList` that inherits from Python’s built-in `list` class. It demonstrates inheritance, where `MyList` can function like a standard list but can be extended with additional functionalities.

---

### Task 2: Check Exact Class Type
**Filename:** `2-is_same_class.py`

This task implements a function that checks if an object is exactly an instance of the specified class (without considering inheritance). It returns `True` if the object is an instance of the class and `False` otherwise.

---

### Task 3: Check If Object Is an Instance of a Class or its Inheritance Chain
**Filename:** `3-is_kind_of_class.py`

This task defines a function that checks whether an object is an instance of a class or an instance of a class that inherits from the specified class. It returns `True` if either condition is met.

---

### Task 4: Check If Object Inherits from a Class
**Filename:** `4-inherits_from.py`

This task implements a function that returns `True` if the object is an instance of a class that is inherited (either directly or indirectly) from the specified class, and `False` otherwise.

---

### Task 5: Empty BaseGeometry Class
**Filename:** `5-base_geometry.py`

This task creates an empty class `BaseGeometry`. It serves as the starting point for further development, where geometric properties and methods will be added in later tasks.

---

### Task 6: BaseGeometry Class with Method
**Filename:** `6-base_geometry.py`

This task extends `BaseGeometry` by adding a method, typically for validation or other geometric operations. The class serves as a foundation for subsequent shapes and their properties.

---

### Task 7: BaseGeometry Class with Additional Functionality
**Filename:** `7-base_geometry.py`

This task further extends the `BaseGeometry` class by introducing more functionality or refining the implementation. It builds on the previous version, making `BaseGeometry` more useful for further inheritance.

---

### Task 8: Rectangle Class Inheriting from BaseGeometry
**Filename:** `8-rectangle.py`

This task defines a `Rectangle` class that inherits from the `BaseGeometry` class. It builds upon the previously defined geometric class and creates a rectangle, which may include validation for the rectangle's properties.

---

### Task 9: Refined Rectangle Class Inheriting from BaseGeometry
**Filename:** `9-rectangle.py`

This task refines the `Rectangle` class further. It ensures that the rectangle is properly initialized with certain properties and adds any required functionality for managing a rectangle’s shape.

---

### Task 10: Square Class Inheriting from Rectangle
**Filename:** `10-square.py`

This task defines a `Square` class that inherits from the `Rectangle` class. It showcases the use of inheritance where a square is a specific type of rectangle with the added constraint of having equal sides.

---

### Task 11: Refined Square Class Inheriting from Rectangle
**Filename:** `11-square.py`

This task further extends the `Square` class, possibly including validation to ensure the square's properties remain consistent. It builds upon the previous square definition, refining the implementation for proper geometric behavior.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates various Python object-oriented programming principles, from inheritance to instance checking. Each task builds on the previous one, progressively introducing more advanced concepts in class design and inheritance.
